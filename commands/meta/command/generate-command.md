description: Intelligent slash command generator with parallel analysis and gold standard best practices
---

## Context

- Session ID: !`gdate +%s%N`
- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Existing .claude directory: !`ls -la .claude 2>/dev/null || echo "No .claude directory found"`
- Current command structure: !`fd "\.md$" .claude/commands 2>/dev/null | head -5 || echo "No existing commands"`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null | head -3 || echo "Not a git repository"`
- Project type indicators: !`fd "(package\.json|deno\.json|Cargo\.toml|go\.mod|pom\.xml)" . -d 2 | head -3`

## Your Task

**CRITICAL: Generate slash commands following the "Program not Conversation" paradigm with parallel analysis for maximum efficiency and gold standard best practices.**

STEP 1: Initialize command generation session with parallel project analysis

- CREATE session state file: `/tmp/generate-command-state-$SESSION_ID.json`
- SET initial state following programming paradigm:
  ```json
  {
    "sessionId": "$SESSION_ID",
    "phase": "discovery",
    "projectType": "auto-detect",
    "commandComplexity": "unknown",
    "userRequirements": {},
    "generatedCommand": null,
    "validationPassed": false,
    "committed": false
  }
  ```

**FOR complex projects OR extensive existing command structures:**

**CRITICAL: Deploy parallel sub-agents for comprehensive project analysis (5-7x faster discovery)**

IMMEDIATELY launch 5 specialized project analysis agents:

- **Agent 1: Project Architecture Analyzer**: Detect technology stack, build systems, and architectural patterns
  - Focus: package.json, deno.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pom.xml, tech stack identification
  - Tools: File pattern analysis, dependency analysis, build system detection
  - Output: Project type classification with recommended command categories

- **Agent 2: Existing Command Pattern Analyzer**: Analyze existing .claude/commands structure and patterns
  - Focus: Command organization, naming conventions, complexity patterns, best practices usage
  - Tools: Command file analysis, pattern recognition, structure mapping
  - Output: Command ecosystem analysis with improvement opportunities

- **Agent 3: Workflow Discovery Agent**: Identify common project workflows and pain points
  - Focus: Git patterns, CI/CD usage, testing strategies, deployment workflows
  - Tools: Git history analysis, configuration analysis, workflow pattern detection
  - Output: Workflow automation opportunities with priority ranking

- **Agent 4: Tool Ecosystem Analyzer**: Map available tools and integration opportunities
  - Focus: Available CLI tools, external APIs, existing automation, tool compatibility
  - Tools: Tool availability checking, integration analysis, permission mapping
  - Output: Tool integration strategy with security considerations

- **Agent 5: Best Practices Validator**: Ensure adherence to gold standard patterns
  - Focus: Session management, security patterns, error handling, state management
  - Tools: Best practices checking, security validation, pattern compliance
  - Output: Compliance assessment with specific improvement recommendations

**Sub-Agent Coordination:**

- Each agent saves findings to `/tmp/command-generation-agents-$SESSION_ID/`
- Parallel execution provides 5-7x speed improvement over sequential analysis
- Cross-agent correlation identifies optimal command design patterns
- Results synthesized for intelligent command specification guidance

STEP 2: Intelligent command specification with programming paradigm guidance

TRY:

**PROCEDURE gather_command_requirements():**

USING parallel analysis results, PROVIDE intelligent project-based suggestions:

**Programming Paradigm Questions (Think "Program not Conversation"):**

1. **Command Purpose & Deterministic Behavior**: What specific, repeatable task should this command automate?

   Examples by project type (from parallel analysis):
   - **Deno projects**: "test-coverage-report", "benchmark-performance", "security-audit"
   - **Rust projects**: "cargo-vulnerability-scan", "performance-profile", "cross-compile"
   - **Go projects**: "generate-mocks", "integration-test-parallel", "memory-profile"
   - **Multi-language**: "dependency-sync", "security-scan-all", "docs-generate"

2. **Command Name & Namespacing**: What should the slash command be called?
   - **Must be kebab-case**: e.g., "security-audit", "test-parallel"
   - **Namespace consideration**: git/, analyze/, ops/, code/, meta/
   - **Accessibility**: `/namespace:command-name` or `/command-name`

3. **Input Pattern & State Management**:
   - **No input**: Deterministic execution based on project state
   - **Single argument**: Use `$ARGUMENTS` token with validation
   - **Structured input**: Design state-based input collection
   - **Session state**: `/tmp/command-state-$SESSION_ID.json` pattern

4. **Execution Model (CRITICAL for performance)**:
   - **Simple Sequential**: Linear steps, no parallelism needed
   - **Parallel Sub-Agent**: Benefits from Task tool delegation (5-10x faster)
   - **Interactive Checkpoint**: User approval points with state preservation
   - **Resumable Workflow**: Long-running with checkpoint/resume capability

5. **Programming Constructs Needed**:
   - **Control Flow**: IF/ELSE, FOR EACH, WHILE loops
   - **Error Handling**: TRY/CATCH/FINALLY blocks
   - **State Machines**: Phase transitions with validation
   - **Unique Sessions**: Nanosecond timestamps for isolation

6. **Security & Tool Permissions** (Minimal Principle):
   - **File operations**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit (specify necessity)
   - **Shell commands**: Bash with scoped restrictions (e.g., Bash(git:*))
   - **External APIs**: WebFetch, WebSearch (justify need)
   - **Sub-processes**: Task (for parallel execution)
   - **Dynamic context**: !`command` vs @file (security implications)

7. **Extended Thinking Integration**:
   - **Simple decisions**: No extended thinking needed
   - **Architectural analysis**: Include "think hard" prompts
   - **Complex trade-offs**: Use "think harder" or "ultrathink"
   - **Multi-perspective**: Combine with parallel sub-agents

**Gold Standard Best Practices Validation:**

FOR EACH generated command, VALIDATE against /commit gold standard:

**CRITICAL Security & Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] **Session ID**: Unique nanosecond timestamp (`gdate +%s%N`)
- [ ] **Minimal Tools**: Only required tools in allowed-tools
- [ ] **Scoped Permissions**: Bash commands properly scoped (e.g., `Bash(git:*)`)
- [ ] **Dynamic Context Testing**: All `!` commands tested individually with fallbacks
- [ ] **Error Handling**: TRY/CATCH blocks for risky operations
- [ ] **State Isolation**: Unique temp files with session ID
- [ ] **Programming Constructs**: Proper STEP/IF/FOR/WHILE patterns
- [ ] **Deterministic Behavior**: Same inputs produce same outputs
- [ ] **Fallback Values**: All commands have `|| echo "fallback"` patterns

**Performance & Parallel Execution Validation:**

- [ ] **Sub-Agent Opportunities**: Analysis tasks use Task tool for parallelism
- [ ] **Batch Operations**: Multiple tool calls in single response where possible
- [ ] **Token Efficiency**: Use file references (@file) vs content inclusion
- [ ] **Context Optimization**: Minimal context window usage with disk serialization

**Programming Paradigm Compliance:**

- [ ] **State Machine Pattern**: Clear phase transitions
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Rollback procedures for critical operations
- [ ] **Human Checkpoints**: User approval for irreversible actions
- [ ] **Modular Design**: Reusable PROCEDURE blocks
- [ ] **Documentation**: Clear examples and usage patterns

STEP 4: Create command directory structure with namespace support

**PROCEDURE create_command_file_structure():**

TRY:

```bash
# Ensure proper namespace directory structure
namespace_path=".claude/commands/${namespace_directory}"
command_file="${namespace_path}/${command_name}.md"

# Create namespace directory if needed
mkdir -p "$namespace_path"
echo "📁 Created namespace directory: $namespace_path"

# Check for existing command with collision detection
IF [ -f "$command_file" ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Command /${namespace}:${command_name} already exists"
  PROMPT user for overwrite confirmation with backup option
  IF overwrite_confirmed:
    # Create backup with timestamp
    backup_file="${command_file}.backup.$(gdate +%s%N)"
    cp "$command_file" "$backup_file"
    echo "💾 Backup created: $backup_file"
  ELSE:
    SUGGEST alternative command names based on existing patterns
    EXIT gracefully with suggestions
fi
```

CATCH (directory_creation_failed):

- CHECK file permissions and provide sudo guidance if needed
- SUGGEST alternative command organization approaches

STEP 5: Write command file with comprehensive validation

**PROCEDURE write_and_validate_command():**

TRY:

- WRITE generated command to determined path with atomic operation
- VALIDATE front matter YAML syntax using local parser
- TEST all dynamic context commands individually:
  ```bash
  # Test each !`command` individually for compatibility
  for context_cmd in "${dynamic_context_commands[@]}"; do
    echo "Testing: $context_cmd"
    eval "$context_cmd" || echo "⚠️ Failed: $context_cmd"
  done
  ```
- VERIFY programming constructs syntax (STEP/IF/FOR patterns)
- VALIDATE session state schema against JSON schema
- CONFIRM error handling completeness using checklist

CATCH (validation_failed):

- LOG specific validation errors to session state
- PROVIDE detailed error explanations with fix suggestions
- ALLOW iterative correction without losing progress

STEP 6: Atomic commit with best practices validation

**IF git repository detected:**

```bash
# CRITICAL: Follow atomic commit workflow from improving-slash-commands.md

# Stage the new command file
git add "$command_file"

# Create conventional commit message following gold standard
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(commands): add /${namespace}:${command_name} with [execution_model] pattern

- Implements ${command_purpose} with deterministic behavior
- Includes ${key_features} (parallel execution, state management, etc.)
- Follows gold standard best practices with security validation
- Provides ${performance_benefit} performance improvement

Generated with programming paradigm compliance and comprehensive testing.
EOF
)"

echo "✅ Command committed with conventional commit format"
```

CATCH (git_commit_failed):

- PROVIDE troubleshooting guidance for common git issues
- SUGGEST manual commit steps with generated message
- PRESERVE command file regardless of commit status

STEP 7: Command testing and verification workflow

**PROCEDURE test_generated_command():**

- DISPLAY command access pattern: `/${namespace}:${command_name} [arguments]`
- SHOW command file location for inspection: `$command_file`
- EXECUTE dry-run validation:
  ```bash
  # Validate all bash commands in Context section
  echo "🧪 Testing dynamic context commands..."
  # [context command testing results]

  echo "📊 Command complexity: ${execution_model}"
  echo "🔧 Tools required: ${allowed_tools}"
  echo "⚡ Performance benefits: ${performance_notes}"
  ```

**Testing Recommendations:**

1. **Security Testing**: Verify minimal permissions and scoped commands
2. **State Isolation**: Test concurrent execution with multiple session IDs
3. **Error Handling**: Simulate failure conditions and verify recovery
4. **Performance**: If parallel execution, verify sub-agent coordination
5. **Integration**: Test with existing command ecosystem

STEP 8: Documentation and team distribution

**PROCEDURE finalize_command_deployment():**

- GENERATE command documentation with usage examples
- UPDATE project README with new command if applicable
- CREATE command catalog entry for team reference
- PROVIDE integration guidance with existing workflows

FINALLY:

**Session cleanup and reporting:**

- SERIALIZE final session state with generation metrics
- CLEAN UP temporary files: `/tmp/generate-command-*-$SESSION_ID.*`
- REPORT successful command generation with performance metrics:
  ```json
  {
    "commandGenerated": "/${namespace}:${command_name}",
    "executionModel": "${execution_model}",
    "performanceBenefit": "${performance_multiplier}x faster",
    "bestPracticesCompliance": "100%",
    "securityValidation": "passed",
    "testingComplete": true
  }
  ```

**Next Steps for User:**

1. **Test the command**: Execute with sample inputs
2. **Review generated file**: Customize if needed for specific project requirements
3. **Share with team**: Document usage patterns and integrate into workflows
4. **Monitor usage**: Track effectiveness and iterate based on feedback
