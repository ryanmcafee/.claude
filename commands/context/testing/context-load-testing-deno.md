description: Load comprehensive Deno testing documentation context with project-specific optimization
---

## Context

- Session ID: !`gdate +%s%N 2>/dev/null || date +%s000000000 2>/dev/null || echo "session-$(date +%s)000000000"`
- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Deno projects: !`fd "deno\\.json" . | head -5 || echo "No Deno projects found"`
- Test files: !`fd "*_test\\.(ts|js)$" . | head -5 || echo "No Deno test files found"`
- Fresh projects: !`rg "(fresh|@fresh)" . --type json | wc -l | tr -d ' ' || echo "0"`
- Testing imports: !`rg "(@std/testing|@std/assert|@std/testing/)" . --type typescript | wc -l | tr -d ' ' || echo "0"`
- Deno configuration: !`fd "(deno\\.json|deno\\.jsonc)" . | head -3 || echo "No Deno config found"`
- Test scripts: !`rg '"test"' . --type json | head -3 || echo "No test scripts found"`
- Technology stack: !`fd "(package\\.json|Cargo\\.toml|go\\.mod)" . | head -3 || echo "Deno-only project"`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain | head -3 || echo "Not a git repository"`

## Your Task

STEP 1: Initialize context loading session

- CREATE session state file: `/tmp/deno-testing-context-$SESSION_ID.json`
- SET initial state:
  ```json
  {
    "sessionId": "$SESSION_ID",
    "phase": "discovery",
    "context_sources": [],
    "loaded_topics": [],
    "project_specific_focus": [],
    "documentation_cache": {},
    "deno_testing_features_detected": []
  }
  ```

STEP 2: Project-specific context analysis

- ANALYZE project structure from Context section
- DETERMINE specific Deno testing frameworks and patterns in use
- IDENTIFY documentation priorities based on project needs

IF Deno projects with existing test files found:

- FOCUS on project-specific testing patterns and optimization
- PRIORITIZE relevant testing strategies (unit, integration, e2e)
- INCLUDE debugging and performance testing contexts
  ELSE:
- LOAD general Deno testing foundation and getting-started guides
- EMPHASIZE setup, configuration, and basic testing patterns
- INCLUDE project setup and test organization workflows

STEP 3: Strategic documentation loading

TRY:

- EXECUTE systematic context loading from prioritized sources
- USE WebFetch tool for each documentation URL
- PROCESS and organize information by functional area
- SAVE loaded context to session state

**Core Documentation Sources:**

FOR EACH priority source:

1. **Deno Testing Fundamentals**
   - URL: `https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/testing/`
   - FETCH: Core Deno.test API, assertions, test organization, coverage
   - FOCUS: Built-in testing framework, test lifecycle, async patterns
   - EXTRACT: Best practices for test structure and execution

2. **Deno Standard Library Testing**
   - URL: `https://jsr.io/@std/testing`
   - FETCH: Assertion library, mocking utilities, test helpers
   - FOCUS: Assert functions, mock creation, test utilities
   - EXTRACT: Advanced testing patterns and mock strategies

3. **Fresh Framework Testing**
   - URL: `https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/concepts/testing`
   - FETCH: Component testing, route testing, island testing patterns
   - FOCUS: Fresh-specific testing strategies and tools
   - EXTRACT: Component isolation, server-side testing, client-side testing

4. **Deno Testing Examples**
   - URL: `https://docs.deno.com/examples/`
   - FETCH: Practical testing patterns, async testing, HTTP testing
   - FOCUS: Real-world testing scenarios and patterns
   - EXTRACT: Complete testing examples and integration patterns

5. **Testing Best Practices Guide**
   - URL: `https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/testing/#best-practices`
   - FETCH: Test organization, performance, debugging strategies
   - FOCUS: Test structure, naming conventions, performance optimization
   - EXTRACT: Professional testing workflows and debugging techniques

6. **Deno Testing CLI Documentation**
   - URL: `https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/cli/test/`
   - FETCH: Test runner configuration, filtering, coverage options
   - FOCUS: CLI options, test filtering, coverage analysis
   - EXTRACT: Advanced test execution and reporting patterns

CATCH (documentation_fetch_failed):

- LOG failed sources to session state
- CONTINUE with available documentation
- PROVIDE manual context loading instructions
- SAVE fallback documentation references

STEP 4: Context organization and optimization

- ORGANIZE loaded context by functional area:
  - Deno.test API and test lifecycle management
  - Assertion patterns and error handling
  - Mock creation and dependency isolation
  - Component testing strategies for Fresh applications
  - Async testing patterns and timing
  - HTTP testing and API endpoint validation
  - File system testing and temporary resources
  - Coverage measurement and reporting
  - Test organization and naming conventions
  - Performance testing and benchmarking

- SYNTHESIZE project-specific guidance:
  - Integration with existing Deno/Fresh codebase
  - Testing strategies for detected frameworks
  - Best practices for project-specific use cases
  - CI/CD integration and automated testing

STEP 5: Session state management and completion

- UPDATE session state with loaded context summary
- SAVE context cache: `/tmp/deno-testing-context-cache-$SESSION_ID.json`
- CREATE context summary report
- MARK completion checkpoint

FINALLY:

- ARCHIVE context session data for future reference
- PROVIDE context loading summary
- CLEAN UP temporary session files

## Context Loading Strategy

**Adaptive Loading Based on Project Type:**

CASE project_context:
WHEN "existing_deno_project_with_tests":

- PRIORITIZE: Test optimization, advanced patterns, performance tuning
- FOCUS: Mock strategies, coverage analysis, CI/CD integration
- EXAMPLES: Complex async testing, database mocking, performance benchmarks

WHEN "fresh_application":

- PRIORITIZE: Component testing, route testing, island architecture testing
- FOCUS: Fresh-specific patterns, server-side rendering tests, client hydration
- EXAMPLES: Route handlers, component isolation, full-stack testing

WHEN "new_deno_project":

- PRIORITIZE: Getting started, basic patterns, test organization
- FOCUS: Deno.test fundamentals, assertion usage, file structure
- EXAMPLES: Basic unit tests, simple mocks, test runner configuration

WHEN "migration_to_deno":

- PRIORITIZE: Migration patterns, compatibility, tooling differences
- FOCUS: Converting existing tests, Deno-specific patterns, dependency updates
- EXAMPLES: Jest to Deno.test migration, mock library replacements

**Context Validation and Quality Assurance:**

FOR EACH loaded documentation source:

- VERIFY documentation currency and Deno version compatibility
- VALIDATE code examples for syntax correctness
- CHECK for deprecated APIs and migration paths
- ENSURE security best practices are highlighted
- CONFIRM examples work with current Deno versions

## Expected Outcome

After executing this command, you will have comprehensive context on:
