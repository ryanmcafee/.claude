## Context

- Session ID: !`gdate +%s%N`
- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Target technology: Temporal Workflow Orchestration
- Documentation base: https://docs.temporal.io/
- Project type detection: !`fd "(go\.mod|Cargo\.toml|package\.json|pom\.xml|requirements\.txt)" . -d 2 | head -3 || echo "No project files detected"`
- Existing Temporal usage: !`rg "temporal" . --type go --type rust --type java --type typescript --type python -i | head -5 || echo "No Temporal usage detected"`

## Your Task

STEP 1: Initialize Temporal context loading session

- SET initial state:
  ```json
  {
    "sessionId": "$SESSION_ID",
    "target": "temporal-workflow-orchestration",
    "phase": "initialization",
    "project_context": "auto-detect",

STEP 2: Project-specific context detection and research strategy

Think hard about the optimal context loading strategy based on detected project characteristics and existing Temporal usage patterns.

Think deeper about enterprise-grade implementation requirements, performance optimization strategies, and production deployment considerations for Temporal workflows.
