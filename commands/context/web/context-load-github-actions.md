---

## Context

- Session ID: !`gdate +%s%N`
- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Project type detection: !`fd "(package\.json|Cargo\.toml|go\.mod|pom\.xml|deno\.json|requirements\.txt|composer\.json|build\.gradle)$" . -d 2 | head -5 || echo "No config files detected"`
- GitHub workflows directory: !`fd "\.github" . -t d -d 3 || echo "No .github directory found"`
- Existing workflows: !`fd "\.(yml|yaml)$" .github/workflows -t f 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ' || echo "0"`
- Workflow patterns: !`rg "(runs-on|uses:|with:)" .github/workflows/ --type yaml -c 2>/dev/null | head -3 || echo "No workflow patterns detected"`
- Repository context: !`git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*github\.com[:/]\([^/]*\/[^/]*\)\.git.*/\1/' || echo "No GitHub remote detected"`
- Technology indicators: !`rg "(cargo|npm|go|maven|gradle|deno)" . --type json --type toml --type yaml -i | head -5 | cut -d: -f3 | sort -u || echo "Technology stack unknown"`
- Container usage: !`fd "(Dockerfile|docker-compose)" . -t f -d 2 || echo "No container files detected"`
- Test frameworks: !`rg "(test|spec)" . --type json --type toml --type yaml | head -3 | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u || echo "No test patterns detected"`

## Your Task

STEP 1: Initialize adaptive GitHub Actions context loading session

- CREATE session state file: `/tmp/github-actions-context-$SESSION_ID.json`
- SET initial state:
  ```json
  {
    "sessionId": "$SESSION_ID",
    "timestamp": "$(gdate -Iseconds 2>/dev/null || date -Iseconds)",
    "project_type": "auto-detect",
    "existing_workflows": 0,
    "technology_stack": [],
    "context_loaded": {
      "core_docs": false,
      "security_guides": false,

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic usage for project analysis and context loading
/context-load-github-actions

# The command will automatically:
# 1. Detect your project's technology stack
# 2. Analyze existing GitHub Actions workflows
# 3. Load relevant documentation and patterns
# 4. Provide customized implementation guidance
```

This command transforms from simple documentation loading into an intelligent, adaptive context loading system that provides precisely the right GitHub Actions knowledge for your specific project and technology stack.
