## Your Task

Execute strategic Cilium documentation loading with project-specific context optimization.

STEP 1: Initialize context loading session

- CREATE session state file: `/tmp/cilium-context-$SESSION_ID.json`
- SET initial state:
  ```json
  {
    "sessionId": "$SESSION_ID",
    "phase": "discovery",
    "context_sources": [],
    "loaded_topics": [],
    "project_specific_focus": [],
    "documentation_cache": {},
    "cilium_features_detected": []
  }
  ```

STEP 2: Project-specific context analysis

TRY:

- ANALYZE Kubernetes and Cilium usage from Context section
- DETERMINE specific Cilium features in use or planned
- IDENTIFY documentation priorities based on project needs

IF Cilium already deployed:

- FOCUS on operational guides, troubleshooting, and advanced features
- PRIORITIZE monitoring, policy management, and performance optimization
- INCLUDE upgrade procedures and cluster management
  ELSE IF Kubernetes cluster detected:
- FOCUS on installation guides, CNI setup, and basic configuration
- PRIORITIZE getting started guides and initial deployment
- INCLUDE migration from existing CNI if applicable
  ELSE:
- LOAD general Cilium concepts and architecture overview
- EMPHASIZE evaluation criteria and deployment planning
- INCLUDE infrastructure requirements and compatibility

CATCH (cluster_access_failed):

- CONTINUE with general Cilium documentation loading
- NOTE cluster access limitations in session state
- FOCUS on documentation that doesn't require live cluster

STEP 3: Strategic documentation loading

Execute systematic context loading from prioritized Cilium documentation sources:

FOR EACH priority documentation source:

1. **Cilium Core Documentation**
   - URL: `https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/overview/intro/`
   - FETCH: eBPF networking concepts, architecture overview, core features
   - FOCUS: CNI functionality, network connectivity, identity-based security
   - EXTRACT: Installation procedures and basic configuration patterns

2. **Network Policy Documentation**
   - URL: `https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/`
   - FETCH: L3/L4 policies, L7 policies, DNS policies, Kafka policies
   - FOCUS: Policy specification, enforcement mechanisms, security isolation
   - EXTRACT: Policy examples and troubleshooting guides

3. **Service Mesh Integration**
   - URL: `https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/servicemesh/`
   - FETCH: Envoy integration, sidecar-less service mesh, traffic management
   - FOCUS: Load balancing, ingress/egress, mutual TLS, observability
   - EXTRACT: Service mesh configuration and operational patterns

4. **Hubble Observability Platform**
   - URL: `https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/observability/hubble/`
   - FETCH: Network visibility, flow monitoring, metrics collection
   - FOCUS: Hubble UI, CLI tools, metrics export, troubleshooting
   - EXTRACT: Observability setup and monitoring best practices

5. **Performance and Operations**
   - URL: `https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/operations/performance/`
   - FETCH: Performance tuning, benchmarking, resource optimization
   - FOCUS: eBPF program optimization, datapath tuning, scalability
   - EXTRACT: Performance monitoring and optimization techniques

6. **Installation and Upgrade Procedures**
   - URL: `https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/installation/`
   - FETCH: Kubernetes installation, Helm charts, operator deployment
   - FOCUS: CNI configuration, cluster requirements, upgrade procedures
   - EXTRACT: Production deployment patterns and best practices

CATCH (documentation_fetch_failed):

- LOG failed sources to session state
- CONTINUE with available documentation
- PROVIDE manual context loading instructions
- SAVE fallback documentation references

STEP 4: Context organization and synthesis

- ORGANIZE loaded context by functional area:
  - eBPF networking fundamentals and architecture
  - CNI installation and cluster integration
  - Network policy specification and enforcement
  - Service mesh capabilities and configuration
  - Load balancing and traffic management
  - Security enforcement and identity management
  - Observability with Hubble and monitoring
  - Performance optimization and tuning
  - Troubleshooting and operational procedures

- SYNTHESIZE project-specific guidance:
  - Integration with existing Kubernetes infrastructure
  - Migration strategies from other CNI solutions
  - Best practices for detected use cases
  - Security considerations for network policies
  - Observability integration with existing monitoring

STEP 5: Session state management and completion

- UPDATE session state with loaded context summary
- SAVE context cache: `/tmp/cilium-context-cache-$SESSION_ID.json`
- CREATE context summary report
- MARK completion checkpoint

FINALLY:

- ARCHIVE context session data for future reference
- PROVIDE context loading summary
- CLEAN UP temporary session files

## Context Loading Strategy

**Adaptive Loading Based on Deployment State:**

CASE cilium_deployment_state:
WHEN "production_cluster":

- PRIORITIZE: Operational guides, monitoring, troubleshooting procedures
- FOCUS: Policy management, performance optimization, upgrade procedures
- EXAMPLES: Production policies, monitoring dashboards, incident response

WHEN "development_cluster":

- PRIORITIZE: Configuration guides, development workflows, testing procedures
- FOCUS: Policy development, feature experimentation, debugging tools
- EXAMPLES: Development policies, testing frameworks, debugging techniques

WHEN "evaluation_phase":

- PRIORITIZE: Architecture overview, feature comparison, deployment planning
- FOCUS: Use case evaluation, integration requirements, migration planning
- EXAMPLES: Architecture diagrams, feature matrices, migration guides

WHEN "new_installation":

- PRIORITIZE: Installation guides, basic configuration, getting started
- FOCUS: CNI setup, initial policies, basic observability
- EXAMPLES: Installation scripts, starter policies, basic monitoring

**Context Validation and Quality Assurance:**

FOR EACH loaded documentation source:

- VERIFY documentation currency and Kubernetes version compatibility
- VALIDATE configuration examples for syntax correctness
- CHECK for deprecated APIs and migration paths
- ENSURE security best practices are highlighted
- CONFIRM examples work with current Cilium versions

## Expected Outcome

After executing this command, you will have comprehensive context on:

**Core Cilium Capabilities:**

- eBPF-based networking and security architecture
- CNI integration and Kubernetes cluster networking
- Identity-based security and network segmentation

- Sidecar-less service mesh functionality

**Operational Excellence:**

- Hubble observability platform and network visibility
- Performance monitoring and optimization techniques
- Troubleshooting network connectivity and policy issues
- Production deployment patterns and best practices
- Upgrade procedures and cluster management
- Integration with monitoring and alerting systems

**Advanced Features:**

- Multi-cluster networking and cluster mesh
- Advanced load balancing algorithms and health checking
- Ingress and egress gateway configuration
- Custom eBPF program development and integration

The context loading adapts to your specific Kubernetes environment and emphasizes the most relevant Cilium documentation areas for your current deployment state and operational needs.

## Session State Management

**State Files Created:**

- `/tmp/cilium-context-$SESSION_ID.json` - Main context loading session state
- `/tmp/cilium-context-cache-$SESSION_ID.json` - Cached documentation content
- `/tmp/cilium-project-analysis-$SESSION_ID.json` - Project-specific findings

**Resumability:**

- Session can be resumed from any checkpoint
- Documentation cache preserved across sessions
- Project analysis results maintained for context adaptation
- Error recovery points established for each major documentation source
