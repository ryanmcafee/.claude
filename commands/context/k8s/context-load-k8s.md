## Context

- Session ID: !`gdate +%s%N`
- Current directory: !`pwd`
- K8s config: !`kubectl config current-context 2>/dev/null || echo "No kubectl context"`
- K8s cluster info: !`kubectl cluster-info --short 2>/dev/null || echo "No cluster connection"`
- K8s manifests: !`fd "\.(yaml|yml)$" . | rg -l "(apiVersion|kind)" | head -10 || echo "No K8s manifests found"`
- Helm charts: !`fd "Chart\.(yaml|yml)$" . | head -5 || echo "No Helm charts found"`
- K8s tools: !`(which kubectl helm kustomize 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ') || echo "0"` available
- Namespaces: !`kubectl get namespaces --no-headers 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ' || echo "0"`
- Running pods: !`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --no-headers 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ' || echo "0"`
- Technology stack: !`fd "(deno\.json|package\.json|Cargo\.toml|go\.mod)" . | head -3 || echo "K8s-only project"`

## Your Task

STEP 1: Initialize context loading session

- CREATE session state file: `/tmp/k8s-context-$SESSION_ID.json`
- VALIDATE session ID generation and file creation permissions
- SET initial state:
  ```json
  {
    "sessionId": "$SESSION_ID",
    "phase": "discovery",
    "cluster_context": null,
    "context_sources": [],
    "loaded_topics": [],
    "k8s_features_detected": [],
    "documentation_cache": {}
  }
  ```

STEP 2: Kubernetes environment analysis

- ANALYZE cluster connectivity and context from Context section
- DETERMINE active Kubernetes features and configurations
- IDENTIFY documentation priorities based on detected environment

IF cluster connection available:

- FOCUS on operational guides, troubleshooting, and cluster management
- PRIORITIZE monitoring, networking, and security documentation
- INCLUDE deployment patterns and best practices for detected workloads

ELSE IF K8s manifests found:

- FOCUS on resource definitions, configuration patterns, and deployment strategies
- PRIORITIZE YAML reference documentation and validation guides
- INCLUDE development workflow and CI/CD integration patterns

ELSE:

- LOAD general Kubernetes foundation and getting-started guides
- EMPHASIZE core concepts, setup guides, and learning resources
- INCLUDE cluster setup and tool installation documentation

STEP 3: Strategic documentation loading

Think deeply about optimal Kubernetes learning and operational documentation strategies for this specific environment. Analyze the cluster configuration, detected workloads, and technology stack to prioritize the most relevant documentation areas.

TRY:

- EXECUTE systematic context loading from prioritized sources
- FOR complex environments with many detected features: Use parallel sub-agents to load different documentation areas simultaneously
- USE WebFetch tool for each documentation URL with targeted focus
- PROCESS and organize information by Kubernetes functional area
- SAVE loaded context to session state

**Core Documentation Sources:**

- SAVE fallback documentation references

STEP 4: Environment-specific context optimization

## Context Loading Strategy

**Adaptive Loading Based on Environment:**

- FOCUS: GitOps workflows and configuration templating

**Context Validation and Quality Assurance:**

FOR EACH loaded documentation source:

- VERIFY documentation currency and Kubernetes version compatibility

- CHECK for deprecated APIs and migration paths
- ENSURE security best practices are highlighted
- CONFIRM examples work with detected Kubernetes version
