description: Load comprehensive observability documentation with project-specific optimization and strategic context loading

## Context

- Session ID: !`gdate +%s%N`
- Current directory: !`pwd`
- Observability tools detected: !`fd "(prometheus|grafana|jaeger|otel|tempo|loki)\.ya?ml$" . | head -5 || echo "No observability configs found"`
- Kubernetes manifests: !`fd "*\.ya?ml$" . | rg "(kind:|apiVersion:)" | head -5 || echo "No K8s manifests found"`
- Monitoring configs: !`fd "(alertmanager|blackbox|node-exporter)\.ya?ml$" . | head -5 || echo "No monitoring configs found"`
- Application instrumentation: !`rg "(prometheus|otel|jaeger|tracing)" . --type go --type java --type python --type javascript | wc -l | tr -d ' ' || echo "0"`
- Technology stack: !`fd "(deno\.json|package\.json|Cargo\.toml|go\.mod|pom\.xml)" . | head -5 || echo "No project files detected"`
- Container environment: !`docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}" 2>/dev/null | rg "(prometheus|grafana|jaeger|tempo)" | head -5 || echo "No observability containers running"`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain | head -3 || echo "Not a git repository"`

## Your Task

STEP 1: Initialize observability context loading session

- CREATE session state file: `/tmp/observability-context-$SESSION_ID.json`
- INITIALIZE state tracking:
  ```json
  {
    "sessionId": "$SESSION_ID",
    "phase": "discovery",
    "detectedTools": [],
    "contextSources": [],
    "loadedTopics": [],
    "projectFocus": [],
    "documentationCache": {}
  }
  ```

STEP 2: Project-specific observability analysis

- ANALYZE project structure from Context section
- DETECT existing observability tooling and configuration
- PRIORITIZE documentation based on project needs and technology stack

IF comprehensive observability stack detected (Prometheus + Grafana + tracing):

- FOCUS on advanced configuration, optimization, and integration patterns
- PRIORITIZE performance tuning, custom metrics, and advanced alerting
- INCLUDE scaling, federation, and multi-cluster observability

ELSE IF partial observability implementation:

- FOCUS on missing components and integration strategies
- PRIORITIZE migration patterns and incremental adoption
- INCLUDE compatibility guides and best practices

ELSE IF new observability project:

- FOCUS on foundational setup, basic configuration, and getting started guides
- PRIORITIZE architecture decisions, tool selection, and initial implementation
- INCLUDE project setup workflows and basic instrumentation patterns

STEP 3: Strategic documentation loading with parallel sub-agents

Think deeply about optimal documentation loading strategy based on project complexity and observability maturity.

IF complex multi-tool observability environment:

- USE Task tool for parallel documentation loading:
  - **Prometheus Agent**: Load metrics, alerting, and federation documentation
  - **Grafana Agent**: Load dashboard design, data sources, and visualization guides
  - **Tracing Agent**: Load Jaeger/Tempo distributed tracing and OpenTelemetry instrumentation
  - **Best Practices Agent**: Load SLO/SLI frameworks, incident response, and optimization guides
- COORDINATE findings across agents for comprehensive understanding

ELSE:

- EXECUTE sequential context loading focused on detected tools and project needs
- PRIORITIZE most relevant documentation areas first

STEP 4: Execute documentation loading workflow

TRY:

- LOAD comprehensive observability documentation from prioritized sources
- USE WebFetch tool for each documentation URL with targeted prompts
- ORGANIZE information by functional area and complexity level
- SAVE loaded context to session state cache

**Core Documentation Sources (load based on project analysis):**

1. **Prometheus Ecosystem**
   - URL: `https://prometheus.io/docs/`
   - FOCUS: Configuration, PromQL querying, alerting rules, federation
   - EXTRACT: Metric collection patterns, performance tuning, storage optimization

2. **Grafana Platform**
   - URL: `https://grafana.com/docs/`
   - FOCUS: Dashboard design, data source integration, alerting, provisioning
   - EXTRACT: Visualization best practices, template variables, advanced features

3. **Distributed Tracing (Jaeger/Tempo)**
   - URL: `https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/`
   - FOCUS: Deployment strategies, sampling, performance optimization
   - EXTRACT: Integration patterns, troubleshooting, scaling considerations

4. **OpenTelemetry Instrumentation**
   - URL: `https://opentelemetry.io/docs/`
   - FOCUS: Auto-instrumentation, manual instrumentation, collectors, exporters
   - EXTRACT: Language-specific SDKs, configuration patterns, best practices

5. **Observability Best Practices**
   - URL: `https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/`
   - FOCUS: Metric naming conventions, instrumentation strategies, performance
   - EXTRACT: SLO/SLI implementation, capacity planning, cost optimization

CATCH (documentation_loading_failed):

- LOG failed sources to session state
- CONTINUE with available documentation
- PROVIDE manual context loading instructions for failed sources
- SAVE fallback documentation references

STEP 5: Context organization and project integration

- SYNTHESIZE loaded documentation into project-relevant guidance
- ORGANIZE by implementation priority and complexity
- CREATE integration roadmap based on current project state
- GENERATE specific recommendations for detected technology stack

STEP 6: Session completion and state management

- UPDATE session state with loaded context summary
- SAVE documentation cache: `/tmp/observability-context-cache-$SESSION_ID.json`
- CREATE context loading report with coverage analysis
- MARK completion checkpoint

FINALLY:

- ARCHIVE context session data for future reference
- PROVIDE comprehensive context loading summary
- CLEAN UP temporary session files: `/tmp/observability-temp-$SESSION_ID-*`

## Expected Outcomes

After executing this command, you will have comprehensive context on:

**Core Observability Capabilities:**

- Prometheus metrics collection, storage, and querying (PromQL)
- Grafana dashboard design, data source integration, and alerting
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger/Tempo and OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- Alert rule configuration, notification routing, and incident response
- SLO/SLI framework implementation and capacity planning

**Advanced Implementation Techniques:**

- Multi-cluster and federated monitoring architectures
- Custom metric development and high-cardinality optimization
- Advanced dashboard templating and dynamic visualization
- Distributed tracing sampling strategies and performance tuning
- Observability automation and GitOps integration

**Project-Specific Integration:**

- Technology stack-specific instrumentation patterns
- Container and Kubernetes observability best practices
- CI/CD pipeline integration and deployment monitoring
- Cost optimization strategies for large-scale observability
- Security considerations and access control implementation

The context loading adapts to your specific project structure and emphasizes the most relevant observability documentation areas for your current monitoring and debugging needs.
