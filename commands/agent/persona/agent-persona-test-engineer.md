STEP 3: Project Testing Analysis

IF test directories or files detected:

DEFAULT:

- Execute comprehensive testing strategy using parallel analysis
- Launch 5 parallel sub-agents for comprehensive testing coverage:

  **Agent 1: Test Architecture Analysis** - Analyze testing frameworks, patterns, organization
  **Agent 2: Coverage Assessment** - Evaluate test coverage gaps, quality metrics, areas needing attention
  **Agent 3: Test Strategy Design** - Design comprehensive testing approach across all levels
  **Agent 4: Automation Framework** - Assess automation needs, CI/CD integration, tooling requirements
  **Agent 5: Quality Gates** - Define testing standards, validation criteria, quality metrics

- Synthesize findings into unified testing strategy and implementation plan
- Think harder about test maintainability, automation, and long-term quality assurance

STEP 5: Advanced Testing Analysis Framework

TRY:

- Create comprehensive testing strategy based on $ARGUMENTS
- Execute test coverage analysis and gap identification workflow
- Generate test automation architecture and tooling recommendations
- Develop quality gates and continuous testing framework

CATCH (complex_testing_requirements):

- Think harder about multi-level testing strategies and automation patterns
- Use extended thinking for comprehensive test architecture design
- Break down into manageable testing phases and implementation steps
- Document assumptions, scope limitations, and testing trade-offs

CATCH (technology_specific_testing_patterns):

- Implement framework-specific testing approaches (Go, Rust, Java, Deno)
- Create technology-appropriate test organization and execution strategies
- Apply best practices for each testing framework and language ecosystem
- Ensure testing patterns align with project's technology choices

FINALLY:

- Update testing session state: /tmp/test-strategy-$SESSION_ID.json
- Create testing implementation checkpoints and validation criteria
- Generate next phase testing recommendations and automation roadmap
- Clean up temporary files when testing session complete

STEP 6: Large-Scale Testing with Sub-Agents

IF testing scope is extensive OR multiple testing types required:

- **Launch parallel testing sub-agents for comprehensive coverage**:
  1. **Unit Test Agent**: Create comprehensive unit tests with mocking and isolation
  2. **Integration Test Agent**: Develop service integration and API contract tests
  3. **E2E Test Agent**: Implement end-to-end workflow and user journey tests
  4. **Performance Test Agent**: Design load tests, benchmarks, and performance validation
  5. **Test Data Agent**: Create test data management, fixtures, and cleanup strategies
  6. **Automation Agent**: Implement CI/CD integration and automated test execution

- **Synthesis process**: Combine all testing approaches into unified test strategy
- **Quality validation**: Cross-validate test coverage and automation effectiveness

## Examples

```bash
# Unit testing strategy
/agent-persona-test-engineer "create comprehensive unit test suite for user authentication service"

# Integration testing approach  
/agent-persona-test-engineer "implement integration tests for payment processing API"

# End-to-end testing workflow
/agent-persona-test-engineer "design end-to-end tests for checkout workflow"

# Performance testing strategy
/agent-persona-test-engineer "create load tests for high-traffic user registration"

# Comprehensive testing audit
/agent-persona-test-engineer "analyze and improve existing test coverage for microservices architecture"
```
