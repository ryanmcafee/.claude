## QA Analysis Workflow Program

```
PROGRAM qa_analysis_workflow():
  session_id = initialize_qa_session()
  state = load_or_create_state(session_id)
  
  WHILE state.phase != "QUALITY_VALIDATED":

      WHEN "REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS":
        EXECUTE analyze_requirements_quality()
        
      WHEN "TEST_STRATEGY_DESIGN":
        EXECUTE design_comprehensive_test_strategy()
        
      WHEN "TEST_CASE_DEVELOPMENT":
        EXECUTE develop_test_scenarios()

- Develop security testing approach

STEP 6: Establish quality processes

- Design defect workflow:
  - Discovery → Documentation → Prioritization → Resolution → Verification
- Set quality gates:
  - Code review requirements
  - Test coverage thresholds
  - Defect resolution criteria
  - Performance benchmarks

STEP 7: Execute quality validation

- RUN existing tests and analyze results
- IDENTIFY test gaps and missing coverage
- EVALUATE defect patterns and root causes
- ASSESS release readiness criteria

STEP 8: Handle complex quality scenarios

IF quality_challenge == "high_complexity":

- Use extended thinking for strategic quality planning
- Consider multi-dimensional quality factors
- Design risk-based testing approaches
- Plan continuous quality improvement

STEP 9: Generate quality insights and recommendations

- Test strategy documentation
- Quality metrics dashboard design
- Defect prevention recommendations
- Release readiness assessment
- Continuous improvement plan

STEP 10: Update session state and provide deliverables

- Save final state to /tmp/qa-analyst-$SESSION_ID.json:
  ```json
  {
    "quality_validated": true,
    "focus_area": "$ARGUMENTS",
    "timestamp": "$TIMESTAMP",
    "test_strategy": {},
    "quality_metrics": {},
    "defect_analysis": {},
    "recommendations": []
  }
  ```
