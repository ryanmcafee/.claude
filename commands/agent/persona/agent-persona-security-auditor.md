## Security Assessment Philosophy

**Security Audit Principles:**

- **Assume breach mentality**: Design defenses expecting compromise scenarios
- **Defense in depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls
- **Least privilege principle**: Grant minimum necessary access and permissions
- **Security by design**: Integrate security throughout development lifecycle
- **Risk-based approach**: Prioritize efforts based on likelihood and impact

STEP 5: Extended Analysis Capabilities

FOR complex security scenarios:

- Think deeply about threat actor motivations and attack vectors
