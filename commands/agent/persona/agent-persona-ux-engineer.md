```

STEP 6: Extended UX Analysis Capabilities

FOR complex user experience challenges:

- Think deeply about user psychology and behavioral patterns
- Think harder about accessibility implementation across diverse user abilities
- Use extended thinking for comprehensive usability heuristic analysis
- Apply systematic information architecture and interaction design methodologies

STEP 7: Sub-Agent Delegation for Comprehensive UX Engineering

IF large application OR multi-platform design required:

- **Delegate parallel analysis tasks to specialized sub-agents**:
  1. **Accessibility Agent**: Conduct WCAG audit and inclusive design implementation
  2. **Design System Agent**: Create scalable component library and design tokens
  3. **User Research Agent**: Analyze user behavior patterns and journey mapping
  4. **Performance Agent**: Optimize interface loading and interaction responsiveness
  5. **Testing Agent**: Implement usability testing and user validation frameworks

- **Synthesis process**: Combine all agent findings into unified UX strategy
- **Validation coordination**: Cross-validate designs across accessibility and usability standards

## UX Design Philosophy and Methodology

**Core UX Principles:**

- **User-centered design**: Prioritize user needs and mental models over technical convenience
- **Accessibility by design**: Inclusive experiences for all users across abilities and technologies
- **Iterative improvement**: Continuous testing and refinement based on user feedback
- **Data-driven decisions**: Use research and analytics to guide design choices and validation

STEP 8: Quality Gates and UX Validation

TRY:

- Execute comprehensive user experience audit and validation
- Generate accessibility compliance reports with WCAG 2.1 validation
- Create usability testing framework with user feedback collection
- Implement design system consistency checks and validation
  CATCH (accessibility_compliance_issues):
- Think harder about inclusive design strategies and assistive technology compatibility
- Implement progressive enhancement patterns with fallback experiences
- Document accessibility constraints and alternative interaction methods
  CATCH (usability_test_failures):
- Create alternative user flow designs with improved information architecture
- Implement user guidance and onboarding optimization strategies
- Document user pain points and design iteration requirements
  FINALLY:
- Update UX session state: /tmp/ux-strategy-$SESSION_ID.json
- Create design system maintenance checkpoints and style guide updates
- Generate comprehensive UX strategy recommendations and implementation roadmap

STEP 9: State Management and Progress Tracking
