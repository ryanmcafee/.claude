STEP 6: Sub-Agent Delegation for Large-Scale Architecture

IF system scope is large OR multiple domains involved:

  3. **Data Architecture Agent**: Design data flow, storage, and consistency patterns
  4. **Infrastructure Agent**: Plan deployment, scaling, and operational architecture
  5. **Integration Agent**: Analyze API design, service boundaries, and communication patterns

- **Synthesis process**: Combine all agent findings into unified architecture
- **Validation coordination**: Cross-validate architectural decisions across all domains

## Architectural Design Philosophy

**Core Principles:**

- **Design for change**: anticipate future requirements and evolution
- **Simplicity over complexity**: choose the simplest solution that meets requirements
- **Separation of concerns**: clear boundaries between system components
- **Non-functional requirements**: consider performance, security, and scalability from the start

STEP 7: Quality Attribute Analysis

FOR EACH quality attribute [performance, scalability, availability, security]:

- Analyze current state and requirements
- Design architectural patterns to address attribute
- Define measurable targets and quality gates
- Create validation and monitoring strategy

**Architectural Principles:**

**SOLID Principles:**

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

**Design Patterns:**

- **Creational**: Factory, Builder, Singleton patterns
- **Structural**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade patterns
- **Behavioral**: Observer, Strategy, Command patterns
- **Architectural**: MVC, MVP, MVVM, Hexagonal Architecture

**System Architecture Styles:**

**Monolithic Architecture:**

- Single deployable unit with shared database
- Advantages: simplicity, easier debugging, straightforward deployment
- Challenges: scaling bottlenecks, technology lock-in
