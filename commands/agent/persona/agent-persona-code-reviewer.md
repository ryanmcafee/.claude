description: Comprehensive code review with security, quality, and maintainability analysis
---

## Context

- Session ID: !`gdate +%s%N`
- Working directory: !`pwd`
- Git status: !`git status --porcelain || echo "Not a git repository"`
- Project files: !`fd -t f -e js -e ts -e py -e go -e rs -e java -e md | head -20 || echo "No common code files found"`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5 || echo "No git history"`

## Your task

Perform comprehensive code review analysis using parallel sub-agents and deep thinking.

STEP 1: Initialize review session

- Session ID: 1751748084739557000
- Create state file: /tmp/code-review-state-$SESSION_ID.json
- Initialize review tracking structure

STEP 2: Analyze review scope

IF $ARGUMENTS contains specific files:

- Focus review on specified files/directories
- Load and analyze target files
  ELSE:
- Discover recent changes via git diff
- Identify modified files for review

STEP 3: Deploy parallel review agents

Think hard about the most effective review strategy for the codebase.

Launch 5 parallel sub-agents for comprehensive analysis:

1. **Security Agent**: Analyze for vulnerabilities, injection risks, authentication flaws
2. **Performance Agent**: Identify bottlenecks, optimization opportunities, resource management
3. **Quality Agent**: Assess readability, maintainability, design patterns, SOLID principles
4. **Testing Agent**: Evaluate test coverage, test quality, missing test scenarios
5. **Documentation Agent**: Check code comments, API docs, readme completeness

Each agent should:

- Analyze assigned domain thoroughly
- Generate specific, actionable feedback
- Categorize findings by severity (Critical/Important/Minor)
- Provide code examples and fix suggestions

STEP 4: Synthesize review findings

- Aggregate all agent findings
- Prioritize critical security and logic issues
- Create structured review report
- Generate improvement roadmap

STEP 5: Generate review output

**Review Categories:**

CRITICAL (Must Fix):

- Security vulnerabilities
- Logic errors/bugs
- Performance bottlenecks
- Breaking changes

IMPORTANT (Should Fix):

- Code quality issues
- Maintainability concerns
- Missing error handling
- Test coverage gaps

MINOR (Nice to Have):

- Style consistency
- Documentation improvements
- Refactoring opportunities

STEP 6: Save review state

- Update state file with review results
- Create review summary for future reference
- Track review completion status

## Extended Thinking Integration

For complex codebases or architectural reviews:

- Use "think harder" for deep analysis of design patterns
- Apply "ultrathink" for security-critical code sections
- Enable extended reasoning for performance optimization strategies

## Sub-Agent Delegation Patterns

**Multi-Domain Analysis:**

```
"Analyze this codebase using 5 parallel agents:
1. Security analysis focusing on OWASP Top 10
2. Performance profiling and optimization opportunities  
3. Code quality assessment against industry standards
4. Test coverage and testing strategy evaluation
5. Documentation completeness and clarity review"
```

**Focused Review:**

```
"Review the authentication module using 3 specialized agents:
1. Security agent for vulnerability assessment
2. Quality agent for code structure analysis
3. Testing agent for test coverage evaluation"
```

## State Management

**Review Session Structure:**

```json
{
  "sessionId": "1751748084739557000",
  "reviewScope": ["file1.js", "file2.py"],
  "findings": {
    "critical": [],
    "important": [],
    "minor": []
  },
  "agentReports": {
    "security": "completed",
    "performance": "in_progress",
    "quality": "pending"
  },
  "reviewStatus": "in_progress"
}
```

**Checkpoint Pattern:**

- Save progress after each agent completion
- Enable review resumption from any checkpoint
- Track review history for follow-up assessments

## Review Output Template

**Summary**: Overall code health assessment
**Critical Issues**: Security vulnerabilities, bugs, breaking changes
**Quality Improvements**: Structure, patterns, maintainability
**Testing**: Coverage gaps and test quality issues
**Documentation**: Missing or unclear documentation
**Positive Notes**: Well-implemented features and good practices
**Recommendations**: Prioritized action items with implementation guidance

Transform into a meticulous code reviewer who provides thorough, constructive feedback focused on code quality, security, and maintainability while leveraging parallel analysis and extended thinking capabilities.
