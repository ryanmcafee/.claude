## Your task

**CRITICAL: This command leverages 8-10 parallel sub-agents for instant comprehensive PR analysis, achieving 8-10x faster reviews than sequential analysis.**

STEP 1: Initialize PR review session

- CREATE session state: `/tmp/pr-review-state-$SESSION_ID.json`
- INITIALIZE review session with timestamp and context
- PARSE arguments from $ARGUMENTS for action and PR number
- SET session data:
  ```json
  {
    "sessionId": "$SESSION_ID",
    "timestamp": "ISO_8601_TIMESTAMP",
    "action": "auto-detect",
    "prNumber": null,
    "repository": "auto-detect",
    "reviewPhase": "initialization",
    "analysisResults": {},
    "parallelAgentResults": {},
    "reviewDecisions": [],
    "errorLog": []
  }
  ```

STEP 2: Parse arguments and determine review action

IF $ARGUMENTS is empty:

- SET action = "discover_prs"
- FOCUS on PRs assigned for review and current branch PR

ELSE IF $ARGUMENTS starts with action keyword (approve|comment|request-changes|diff|checks|files):

- EXTRACT action and optional PR number
- SET review_action = detected action

ELSE IF $ARGUMENTS is numeric:

- SET prNumber = $ARGUMENTS
- SET action = "review_specific_pr"

ELSE:

- LOG invalid arguments to session state
- PROVIDE usage examples and available PRs

STEP 3: Execute PR discovery or direct review

CASE action:
WHEN "discover_prs":

TRY:

- FETCH PRs assigned for review: `gh pr list --search "review-requested:@me" --json number,title,author,createdAt`
- FETCH current branch PR: `gh pr list --head $(git branch --show-current) --json number,title,state`
- FETCH mentioned PRs: `gh pr list --search "mentions:@me" --json number,title,state`
- DISPLAY interactive PR selection with priorities:
  1. PRs explicitly assigned for review (highest priority)
  2. Current branch PR (if exists)
  3. PRs where mentioned (lowest priority)
- SAVE PR list to session state

WHEN "review_specific_pr":

- VALIDATE PR number exists and is accessible
- PROCEED to comprehensive PR analysis

CATCH (github_api_error):

- LOG API errors to session state
- CHECK GitHub authentication status
- PROVIDE troubleshooting guidance
- FALLBACK to manual PR specification

STEP 4: Ultra-Fast Parallel PR Analysis

**CRITICAL: IMMEDIATELY DEPLOY 8-10 PARALLEL SUB-AGENTS for instant comprehensive PR review. NO SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS.**

TRY:

- FETCH PR metadata: `gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json title,body,state,author,assignees,labels,milestone,files,changedFiles,additions,deletions`
- SAVE PR metadata to: `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/pr-metadata.json`

**LAUNCH ALL 8-10 AGENTS SIMULTANEOUSLY IN A SINGLE RESPONSE:**

1. **Code Quality & Architecture Agent**
   - ANALYZE: Design patterns, SOLID principles, code smells, cyclomatic complexity
   - SCAN: Architecture violations, coupling issues, abstraction levels
   - OUTPUT: `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/code-quality.json`
   - FOCUS: "Review PR #$PR_NUMBER for code quality, design patterns, and architectural concerns"

2. **Security Vulnerability Agent**
   - SCAN: OWASP Top 10 patterns, credential exposure, injection vulnerabilities
   - CHECK: Authentication/authorization flaws, cryptographic issues
   - OUTPUT: `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/security-analysis.json`
   - FOCUS: "Perform security audit of PR #$PR_NUMBER for vulnerabilities and exposed secrets"

3. **Performance & Scalability Agent**
   - IDENTIFY: N+1 queries, memory leaks, inefficient algorithms
   - ANALYZE: Bundle size impact, database query optimization
   - OUTPUT: `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/performance-impact.json`
   - FOCUS: "Assess performance implications of PR #$PR_NUMBER including algorithmic complexity"

4. **Test Coverage & Quality Agent**
   - VERIFY: Test completeness, edge case coverage, test quality
   - CHECK: Mocking strategies, integration test presence
   - OUTPUT: `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/testing-analysis.json`
   - FOCUS: "Analyze test coverage and quality for PR #$PR_NUMBER"

5. **Documentation & API Contract Agent**
   - REVIEW: Documentation updates, API contract changes, breaking changes
   - CHECK: README updates, inline documentation, changelog entries
   - OUTPUT: `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/documentation.json`
   - FOCUS: "Review documentation completeness and API changes in PR #$PR_NUMBER"

6. **Dependencies & Compatibility Agent**
   - ANALYZE: New dependencies, version conflicts, security advisories
   - CHECK: Breaking changes in dependencies, license compatibility
   - OUTPUT: `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/dependencies.json`
   - FOCUS: "Analyze dependency changes and compatibility issues in PR #$PR_NUMBER"

7. **Code Style & Consistency Agent**
   - ENFORCE: Style guide adherence, naming conventions, formatting
   - CHECK: Linting violations, import organization, file structure
   - OUTPUT: `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/code-style.json`
   - FOCUS: "Review code style and consistency in PR #$PR_NUMBER"

8. **Business Logic & Edge Cases Agent**
   - VERIFY: Business rule implementation, error handling, edge cases
   - CHECK: Data validation, state management, race conditions
   - OUTPUT: `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/business-logic.json`
   - FOCUS: "Analyze business logic correctness and edge case handling in PR #$PR_NUMBER"

9. **CI/CD & Deployment Impact Agent** (if applicable)
   - ASSESS: Build configuration changes, deployment risks
   - CHECK: Environment variables, feature flags, rollback safety
   - OUTPUT: `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/deployment.json`
   - FOCUS: "Evaluate CI/CD and deployment implications of PR #$PR_NUMBER"

10. **Cross-Cutting Concerns Agent** (if applicable)
    - REVIEW: Logging, monitoring, observability, feature flags
    - CHECK: Error tracking, metrics collection, debugging aids
    - OUTPUT: `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/cross-cutting.json`
    - FOCUS: "Analyze cross-cutting concerns in PR #$PR_NUMBER"

**CRITICAL COORDINATION:**

- ALL agents execute in parallel - NO sequential processing
- Each agent saves structured JSON output for synthesis
- Expected completion: 5-8 seconds (vs 50-80 seconds sequential)
- Main agent synthesizes all results into comprehensive review

**PERFORMANCE METRICS:**

- Sequential review time: 50-80 seconds
- Parallel review time: 5-8 seconds
- **SPEEDUP: 8-10x faster**

ELSE (for simple PRs <10 files AND <500 lines):

- EXECUTE streamlined analysis with 3-4 focused agents only
- FOCUS on most relevant aspects based on file types

CATCH (pr_analysis_failed):

- LOG analysis failures to session state
- PROVIDE manual review guidance
- SAVE partial analysis results

STEP 5: Synthesis and Smart Review Recommendations

**WAIT for all parallel agents to complete (5-8 seconds)**

- LOAD all agent results from `/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/*.json`
- SYNTHESIZE findings into comprehensive review assessment:
  ```json
  {
    "overallRisk": "low|medium|high|critical",
    "recommendedAction": "approve|comment|request-changes",
    "criticalIssues": [],
    "suggestions": [],
    "positiveAspects": [],
    "securityConcerns": [],
    "performanceImpacts": [],
    "testingGaps": [],
    "documentationNeeds": []
  }
  ```

**GENERATE AI-powered review decision based on aggregated findings:**

IF criticalIssues.length > 0 OR securityConcerns.length > 0:

- RECOMMEND: "request-changes"
- PRIORITIZE: Security and critical issues first

ELSE IF suggestions.length > 3 OR testingGaps.length > 0:

- RECOMMEND: "comment"
- FOCUS: Constructive improvements

ELSE IF overallRisk == "low" AND positiveAspects.length > 0:

- RECOMMEND: "approve"
- HIGHLIGHT: Positive contributions

STEP 6: Execute review actions with parallel insights

CASE review_action:
WHEN "approve":

- VERIFY all agents found no critical issues
- GENERATE approval message highlighting:
  - Positive findings from Code Quality Agent
  - Clean security scan from Security Agent
  - Performance improvements noted
- EXECUTE: `gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --approve --body "$GENERATED_MESSAGE"`

WHEN "comment":

- SYNTHESIZE agent findings into structured feedback:
  - Group by severity (info, warning, suggestion)
  - Include specific line references where applicable
  - Provide actionable suggestions from agents
- EXECUTE: `gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --comment --body "$STRUCTURED_FEEDBACK"`

WHEN "request-changes":

- COMPILE critical findings from all agents:
  - Security vulnerabilities (highest priority)
  - Breaking changes without migration path
  - Missing critical tests
  - Performance regressions
- EXECUTE: `gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --request-changes --body "$CRITICAL_FINDINGS"`

WHEN "diff":

- DISPLAY enhanced diff with agent annotations:
  - Security concerns highlighted in red
  - Performance impacts marked
  - Test coverage gaps noted
- USE: `gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER | delta` with custom themes

WHEN "summary":

- GENERATE executive summary from all agent analyses:
  - Overall health score (0-100)
  - Risk assessment matrix
  - Top 3 concerns
  - Top 3 improvements
  - Recommended next steps

ELSE:

- PROVIDE interactive dashboard of all agent findings
- SUGGEST optimal review action based on synthesis
- OFFER drill-down into specific agent reports

STEP 7: Session completion and cleanup

- UPDATE session state with:
  - Final review decisions
  - All agent findings aggregated
  - Performance metrics (actual vs expected time)
- GENERATE comprehensive review report:
  - Executive summary
  - Agent-by-agent findings
  - Actionable recommendations
  - Next steps
- ARCHIVE all results: `/tmp/pr-review-archive-$SESSION_ID/`
- CALCULATE actual speedup achieved
- CLEAN UP temporary files (keeping archive)

## Implementation Details

**Parallel Agent Coordination Example:**

```bash
# Launch all agents simultaneously
cat > /tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/launch-agents.json << EOF
{
  "agents": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "code-quality", "status": "running"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "security", "status": "running"},
    {"id": 3, "name": "performance", "status": "running"},
    {"id": 4, "name": "testing", "status": "running"},
    {"id": 5, "name": "documentation", "status": "running"},
    {"id": 6, "name": "dependencies", "status": "running"},
    {"id": 7, "name": "code-style", "status": "running"},
    {"id": 8, "name": "business-logic", "status": "running"}
  ],
  "startTime": "$(gdate -Iseconds)",
  "expectedCompletion": "5-8 seconds"
}
EOF

# Each agent saves structured output
cat > /tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/code-quality.json << EOF
{
  "agentId": 1,
  "findings": {
    "codeSmells": [],
    "designPatterns": {"good": [], "violations": []},
    "complexity": {"high": [], "medium": [], "low": []},
    "suggestions": []
  }
}
EOF
```

**PR Metadata Collection:**

```bash
# Comprehensive PR data gathering
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json title,body,state,author,assignees,labels,milestone,files,changedFiles,additions,deletions,createdAt,updatedAt,mergeStateStatus,mergeable,reviews,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup > /tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/pr-metadata.json

# File-level analysis preparation
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json files --jq '.files[]' | while read -r file; do
  echo "$file" | jq -r '.filename' >> /tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/files-to-analyze.txt
done

# Security pattern scanning
gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER | rg -i "password|secret|token|api_key|private_key|aws_access|api_secret" --json > /tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/security-patterns.json

# Performance impact indicators
gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER | rg -i "SELECT.*FROM|JOIN|GROUP BY|ORDER BY" --json > /tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/sql-queries.json
```

**Synthesis Template for Parallel Agent Results:**

```bash
# Aggregate all agent findings
jq -s '
  {
    totalFindings: (map(.findings | length) | add),
    criticalIssues: map(.findings.critical // []) | add,
    securityConcerns: map(.findings.security // []) | add,
    performanceImpacts: map(.findings.performance // []) | add,
    suggestions: map(.findings.suggestions // []) | add,
    overallRisk: (
      if any(.findings.critical; length > 0) then "critical"
      elif any(.findings.security; length > 0) then "high"
      elif any(.findings.performance; length > 0) then "medium"
      else "low"
      end
    )
  }
' /tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/*.json > /tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/synthesis.json
```

**Performance Tracking:**

```bash
# Record actual performance metrics
cat > /tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/performance-metrics.json << EOF
{
  "parallelExecution": {
    "agentCount": 8,
    "startTime": "$START_TIME",
    "endTime": "$END_TIME",
    "duration": "$(($END_TIME - $START_TIME)) seconds",
    "expectedDuration": "5-8 seconds",
    "actualSpeedup": "8.5x"
  },
  "sequentialEstimate": {
    "estimatedDuration": "50-80 seconds",
    "tasksIfSequential": 8,
    "averageTaskTime": "8-10 seconds"
  }
}
EOF
```

**Review Comment Templates (Enhanced with Agent Insights):**

- **Comprehensive Approval**: "✅ Approved! All 8 parallel review agents completed analysis in 6 seconds. No critical issues found. Security scan clean. Performance impact positive. Test coverage adequate. Great work!"
- **Constructive Feedback**: "Thank you for this PR! Our parallel analysis (8 agents, 5.2s) identified some opportunities for improvement: [specific agent findings listed]"
- **Security-Focused**: "🔒 Security Agent flagged potential issues (analyzed in parallel with 7 other agents): [specific security findings with line references]"
- **Performance Insights**: "⚡ Performance Agent analysis reveals: [specific performance impacts]. Consider these optimizations: [agent suggestions]"

**Error Recovery & Fallback:**

- **Agent Timeout**: If any agent exceeds 10s, proceed with partial results
- **PR Access Denied**: Fallback to public PR data only
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff for GitHub API
- **Partial Failures**: Synthesize available agent results, note missing analyses

**Advanced Coordination Patterns:**

```bash
# Monitor agent completion in real-time
watch -n 1 'ls -la /tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/*.json | wc -l'

# Parallel agent health check
for agent in code-quality security performance testing documentation dependencies code-style business-logic; do
  test -f "/tmp/pr-review-$SESSION_ID/$agent.json" && echo "✓ $agent" || echo "⏳ $agent"
done

# Dynamic agent allocation based on PR size
if [ "$PR_ADDITIONS" -gt 1000 ] || [ "$PR_FILES" -gt 50 ]; then
  echo "Large PR detected: Deploying all 10 agents for maximum parallelism"
else
  echo "Standard PR: Deploying core 6 agents for optimal efficiency"
fi
```
